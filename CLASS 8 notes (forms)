DAY 8 CLASS NOTES:  FORMS

- user Input
- enter text
- the have methods & URLS (side functionality so that forms can communicate with the server, but we won't mess with this)
- inputs(tag name) go in forms....self closing
- inputs have types, have to set type
- we submit forms, a form will have something that triggers turning over all this information
