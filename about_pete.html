    <p class = "about_pete"> Seattle's Salmon Cookies is the Dima Family's labor of love.  When year-old Elizabeth Dima wanted to sell salmon-shaped cookies at her curb-side coffee stand, mom, Sara, and dad, Pete, tried tried to dissuade their daughter from actually using local-caught fresh salmon. But Elizabeth insisted, even going so far as to meticulously sketch out and color (see below) exactly what she wanted each cookie to look like.  When the family saw Elizabeth's edication, everyone jumped on board to help. Even 10-year-old brother, Charlie pitched in, by helping to cut and bake cookies for Elizabeth to ice with cream-cheese frosting.  Soon, Elizabeth's' neighborhood coffee stand was all the rage in Capitol Hill, and Seattle's' Salmon Cookies first storefront location was not far behind.  After just 3 years, the Dima family just opened up their fifth location throughout the city, with more cookie stands on the way soon!
